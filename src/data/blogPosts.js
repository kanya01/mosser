            introduction: 'Something unusual is happening in financial markets. Credit default swaps (CDS)—essentially insurance against corporate defaults—for major tech companies have surged 90% since September 2025. Oracle\'s CDS costs hit levels not seen since 2009. Meta sold $30 billion in bonds to fund AI infrastructure. And investors are increasingly nervous about whether any of this spending will actually pay off. This isn\'t just Wall Street drama—it\'s a signal that the AI gold rush might be built on shakier ground than the hype suggests.',

But what if you\'re worried they might not? That\'s where CDS comes in. You pay a premium to someone else who agrees to cover your losses if the company defaults. The higher the premium, the riskier the company looks. When Oracle\'s CDS costs triple in a year, it means investors think Oracle is significantly more likely to struggle with its debt than before. It\'s not a prediction of collapse—it\'s a measurement of growing anxiety.',

Third, the market volatility: disappointing earnings from Oracle and Broadcom sent shockwaves through AI stock valuations, revealing how fragile market confidence really is. Fourth, the debt burden: these companies are taking on massive debt loads at a time when interest rates remain elevated, meaning debt servicing costs are higher than they would have been in the 2010s low-rate environment.',

"Eyeballs" and "network effects" justified astronomical valuations—until they didn\'t. When the bubble burst, many of those infrastructure investments became stranded assets. Today, we\'re seeing similar patterns: massive capital deployment based on transformative technology narratives, valuations that assume best-case scenarios, and a disconnect between current spending and demonstrable returns. However, there are key differences: AI is already driving real productivity gains in specific use cases (code generation, customer service automation, content creation), the companies making these bets are profitable giants with diverse revenue streams (unlike 1999\'s money-losing startups), and the underlying technology is genuinely transformative (even if the timeline and magnitude of returns are uncertain).',

The fact that the lender is willing to pay that much means they\'re worried. And if multiple lenders are all buying this insurance, it means there\'s widespread concern.

The CDS surge, massive debt raises, and investor nervousness all point to a market that\'s sobering up about the timeline and magnitude of AI returns. This doesn\'t mean AI is a bust. The technology is real, the productivity gains are measurable, and the transformative potential remains genuine. But the gap between today\'s spending and tomorrow\'s returns is wider than many investors are comfortable with. For those of us watching from outside the C-suite, the lesson is simple: transformative technology rarely follows a straight line from hype to reality. There are always corrections, skepticism, and periods where the narrative shifts from "this changes everything" to "maybe this changes some things." We\'re entering that phase now. Whether that makes this a buying opportunity or a warning sign depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. But one thing is clear: the market is telling us the AI party is entering a more sober phase. How sober? The CDS market will keep us posted.'
