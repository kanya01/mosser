Privacy and security questions around code being processed by Google\'s models need addressing.

After trailing competitors for much of 2024-25, Google has delivered products that don\'t just catch up—they chart a compelling vision for the future. Antigravity, in particular, demonstrates the kind of first-principles product thinking that defined earlier Google innovations. Whether it achieves mass adoption remains to be seen, but it\'s already forced the entire industry to think bigger about what AI-native development could be. For product builders, the lesson is clear: sometimes the answer isn\'t incrementally improving the existing paradigm—it\'s creating an entirely new one.'
